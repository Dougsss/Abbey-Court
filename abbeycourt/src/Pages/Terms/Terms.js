                    PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND CREDIT CARD PAYMENT PROCESSES
                    Except in the case of Guests that avail of “Prepay and Save rates”, Guests will be asked for full payment of the balance on arrival, in cash or by using their credit or debit card and verification with the latest “Chip and Pin” technology.

                    Depending on accommodation selected, guests may also be asked to pay a Security Deposit on arrival by pre-authorisation of their card. (see section below on Security Deposits).

                    As a security measure “Prepay and Save” customers and customers who have booked through 3rd party agents and prepaid in full will either be required to pre-authorise their credit or debit card and to produce a valid ID on arrival.

                    Abbey Court accepts all major credit cards and debit cards.

                    Abbey Court does not accept cheques unless previously agreed with Management.

                    CANCELLATIONS & NO SHOWS
                    Cancellation of a reservation will be effective only from the time of receipt.

Cancellations must be made by e-mail. Confirmation of cancellation will then be sent to you. If you do not receive confirmation, then your cancellation may not have been received. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure proper receipt of their cancellation.

Cancellation of hostel accommodation must be made not later than 24 hours prior to check in (14:30). Later cancellation will incur a cancellation fee of not less that the full amount of the first night’s accommodation charge.

We strongly recommend that all Customers obtain appropriate travel and personal insurance cover.

Cancellations are subject to the following;

1. Deposits paid (Prepay and Save) are non-refundable.

2. Apartment cancellations must be received by email at least 14 days and hostel cancellations at least 24 hours before the arrival date, to info@abbey-court.com or to the cancellation address provided on the website through which the Customer’s booking was made.

No further charges will be made for cancellations made prior to the deadline, other than the loss of any deposit paid.

3. If a customer fails to arrive or tries to cancel within the appropriate period before their due arrival date – they are treated as a “No Show” and the full amount will be charged and is non-refundable.

4. Cancellations are not permitted on “Prepay and Save” rates, as the full cost including any extra services are charged at the time of reservation. If you cancel for any reason or attempt to modify the reservation or do not arrive on your specified check in date, your payment is non-refundable.

5. The Customer agrees that the above cancellation charges are a fair and genuine estimate of the loss that Abbey Court would incur on the cancellation of a booking.

RESERVATIONS MADE VIA OTHER CHANNELS
Bookings made through other sources including online travel agents, tour operators or other websites may be subject to different policies. Please refer to your confirmation for details.

ACCOMMODATION AMENDMENTS BY ABBEY COURT
Whilst all reasonable efforts have been taken by Abbey Court to ensure that bookings made under this Agreement are able to proceed, we reserve the right to relocate any booking to accommodation of similar size and standard in the locality. The Customer acknowledges that Abbey Court accepts no liability for any loss or damage suffered by or caused to the Customer as a consequence of the relocation.

In exceptional circumstances Abbey Court may find it necessary to cancel your booking. If this occurs Abbey Court will refund any sum the Customer has paid which shall constitute a full and final settlement of any liability Abbey Court may have to the Customer as a result of such cancellation.

Abbey Court will not be liable for any delay, loss, damage or expenses incurred if your booking needs to be altered or cancelled, if it is unable to perform its contractual obligations as a result of events beyond its reasonable control, which shall include but not be limited to events such as war, civil strife, terrorist activity, labour disputes, natural or man-made disaster, fire, flood, and adverse weather conditions.

Note: Abbey Court reserve the right to refuse admission at any time.

REFUNDS

Due to the impact of Covid-19, we will not process cash refunds but will offer a credit note of similar value and should that not be acceptable then we will offer a cash refund three months after the pandemic has been declared over

ALTERATIONS TO BOOKING REQUESTED BY CUSTOMER
If a Customer wishes to alter their booking (e.g. change the dates of stay or the accommodation requested), Abbey Court cannot guarantee that it will be able to do so and it accepts no liability for any loss, damage or additional expense that may be incurred in these circumstances.

While amendments are not permitted with Prepay & Save Rates, they are possible with Standard bookings depending on availability, if requested at least 14 days prior to arrival. Additional costs may be incurred if the cost of accommodation on the new nights varies from the previous booking. All amendment requests must be received in writing.

SECURITY DEPOSITS FOR DAMAGE, EXTRAS AND CLEANING – PRE-AUTHORISATION OF CARDS
Abbey Court reserves the right to charge a Security Deposit upon check-in.

Groups of 6 or more persons must pay a fully refundable deposit of not less than €30 per person prior to check in.

The payment will be used to cover incidental items including, but not limited to, breakages, damage to property, additional cleaning costs due to the apartment being left in an unacceptable state, excessive electricity usage, and breaches to regulations such as smoking in the hostel or causing disturbance of other guests enjoyment of the property. Security Deposits may also be used by Management in the event of unauthorised extra guests entering the hostel premises and using the facilities.

Security Deposits held on a credit card (via a pre-authorisation) or charged to a debit card will be refunded as per the issuing bank’s policy. Typically this may take between 3-10 working days; however some banks do take longer.

Customers should note that with pre-authorisation no money is transferred at the time, but it will affect your available funds balance and spending limits on the card while the pre-authorisation exists. Abbey Court is not liable for any delays in refunding pre-authorisations by credit card companies.

If disturbance to other guests has occurred or any damage to the property, the cost to Abbey Court will be retained from the Security Deposit, and only the balance returned to the Customer.

If this cost exceeds the value of the Security Deposit, the Customer agrees to indemnify Abbey Court for the damage, additional cleaning costs or other charges and agrees to pay all costs of recovery including all legal costs, and other expenses.

The Customer hereby gives consent to Abbey Court to apply to the Customer’s credit card all reasonable charges incurred which may not be covered by the Security Deposit.
